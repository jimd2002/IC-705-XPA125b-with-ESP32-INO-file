This is the INO file for programming the ESP 32 module with the arduino IDE for controlling the XPA125b amplifier with an Icom IC-705 radio for remote bluetooth bandswitching.  
I used the WROOM32 driver in the Arduino sketch.
You will also need the driver from Espressif Systems for your ESP32 board.
This version V1.00a has all of the comments added and is the latest version since May 12, 2025.  Feel free to modify at will.
